## Progress Report

### Completed Features or Tasks
- Updated `AmazonDSPService.js` to use `application/json` for `Content-Type` and `JSON.stringify` for the authentication request body.
- Successfully pushed all code changes, including the authentication fix, new `dsp-proxy`, and generated OpenAPI client, to the GitHub repository.
- Changed proxy server port to `8080` and updated frontend `baseURL` accordingly.
- Identified that Amazon requires HTTPS for Return URLs.
- Updated frontend `baseURL` to use the `ngrok` HTTPS URL.
- User has successfully set up `ngrok` and added the `ngrok` HTTPS URL to "Allowed Return URLs" in Amazon Security Profile.

### Current Work in Progress
- Guiding user to add `localhost` origins to "Allowed JavaScript Origins" in Amazon Security Profile.

### Known Issues or Challenges
- Previously encountered internal Git errors in the sandbox environment, which have now been resolved.
- User is reporting the login page is not appearing locally.
- Persistent `403 Forbidden` error on authentication endpoint, now identified as likely due to missing `localhost` in "Allowed JavaScript Origins".

### Next Steps
- Guide user to update "Allowed JavaScript Origins" in Amazon Security Profile.
- Wait for user feedback on authentication test.
