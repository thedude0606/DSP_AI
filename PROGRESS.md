# Project Progress

## Current Status

- **Phase 1: Extract and synthesize API documentation from provided HTML files**
  - In progress: Analyzing provided HTML files to extract relevant Amazon DSP API information.

## Completed Features/Tasks

- Initial task planning and phase definition.
- Attempted to clone provided GitHub repository for API documentation (repository was empty).

## Known Issues/Challenges

- The provided GitHub repository `DSP_AI` is empty, so API specifications cannot be directly extracted from it.
- The previously downloaded OpenAPI files from Amazon's website were HTML content, not actual OpenAPI JSON files.

## Next Steps

- Continue extracting and synthesizing API documentation from the previously uploaded HTML files.
- Create `TODO.md` and `DECISIONS.md` files.
- Push initial documentation files to the `DSP_AI` repository.
