## User Experience Flow

### Primary Workflow

**Step 1: Authentication Setup**
Users begin by configuring their API credentials through a secure, guided setup process. The interface provides clear instructions and validation feedback to ensure proper connection to Amazon DSP services.

**Step 2: Entity Selection**
A streamlined selection interface allows users to choose their advertising entity and associated advertiser accounts. The interface provides search functionality and clear visual hierarchy to facilitate quick selection.

**Step 3: Campaign Configuration**
The campaign creation process follows a logical progression from basic information through advanced targeting options. Each step provides contextual help and validation to prevent errors and ensure optimal campaign setup.

**Step 4: Targeting Definition**
Users define their target audience through an intuitive interface that combines geographic, demographic, and behavioral targeting options. The system provides real-time feedback on audience size and reach potential.

**Step 5: Inventory Selection**
A comprehensive inventory browser allows users to explore and select from available publisher deals, contextual groups, and Amazon O&O inventory. Each option provides detailed information about reach, pricing, and performance expectations.

**Step 6: Forecast Review**
Before finalizing the campaign, users review comprehensive forecasting data that projects campaign performance based on their configuration choices. The interface allows for iterative refinement of targeting and inventory selection.

**Step 7: Campaign Launch**
Final campaign review and launch process with confirmation dialogs and success feedback. The system provides clear next steps and monitoring recommendations.

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### Frontend Architecture

**React Component Structure:**
- App.jsx (Main application container)
- AuthenticationManager.jsx (Credentials and profile management)
- CampaignBuilder.jsx (Campaign creation workflow)
- TargetingInterface.jsx (Geographic and audience targeting)
- InventoryBrowser.jsx (Publisher deals and inventory selection)
- ForecastingDashboard.jsx (Performance projections)
- SharedComponents/ (Reusable UI elements)

**State Management:**
Redux Toolkit for global state management with separate slices for authentication, campaign data, targeting configuration, inventory selection, and forecasting results.

**Styling Approach:**
Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and component classes. CSS modules for component-specific styling and animations.

### Backend Integration

**API Service Layer:**
Dedicated service classes for each Amazon DSP API category:
- AuthenticationService.js
- CampaignManagementService.js
- TargetingService.js
- InventoryService.js
- ForecastingService.js

**Data Management:**
Local storage for credentials and user preferences, with encrypted storage for sensitive information. Session storage for temporary campaign configuration data.

### Performance Optimization

**Code Splitting:**
Lazy loading for major components to reduce initial bundle size and improve loading performance.

**Caching Strategy:**
Intelligent caching for API responses, particularly for inventory data and targeting options that change infrequently.

**Progressive Enhancement:**
Core functionality available immediately with enhanced features loading progressively as resources become available.
