## Progress Report

### Completed Features or Tasks
- Updated `AmazonDSPService.js` to use `application/json` for `Content-Type` and `JSON.stringify` for the authentication request body.
- Successfully pushed all code changes, including the authentication fix, new `dsp-proxy`, and generated OpenAPI client, to the GitHub repository.

### Current Work in Progress
- Waiting for user to pull latest changes and test the authentication fix locally.

### Known Issues or Challenges
- Previously encountered internal Git errors in the sandbox environment, which have now been resolved.
- User is reporting the login page is not appearing locally.

### Next Steps
- Guide user to verify local setup and test the authentication fix.
- Troubleshoot local environment issues (e.g., proxy/frontend server not running) if the login page still doesn't appear.
- Continue troubleshooting API connectivity issues if they persist after authentication fix.
