## Current Work in Progress
- Phase 5: Building backend API integration layer
  - Testing real Amazon DSP API authentication
  - Implementing campaign creation and management
  - Optimizing API error handling and retry logic

## Known Issues/Challenges

- Amazon DSP API requires proper authentication setup with valid credentials
- Forecast API may have rate limits that need to be handled gracefully
- Some inventory availability may vary based on account permissions

## Next Steps

1. Test the application with real Amazon DSP API credentials
2. Implement backend API integration layer for production deployment
3. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. Implement campaign management and reporting features
5. Deploy the application for production use
