# To-Do List

## Phase 1: Extract and synthesize API documentation from provided HTML files

- [ ] Analyze each HTML file to identify API endpoints, request/response structures, authentication methods, and data models.
- [ ] Consolidate extracted information into a structured API documentation format (e.g., Markdown).
- [ ] Identify gaps or ambiguities in the documentation that require further research.

## Phase 2: Set up GitHub repository and initial project documentation

- [x] Create `PROGRESS.md`.
- [ ] Create `TODO.md`.
- [ ] Create `DECISIONS.md`.
- [ ] Push initial documentation files to the `DSP_AI` repository.

## Phase 3: Design UI architecture and user experience

- [ ] Create comprehensive UI/UX design document.
- [ ] Define component architecture and data flow patterns.
- [ ] Specify user interface layouts and interaction patterns.
- [ ] Document security and performance requirements.

## Phase 4: Implement frontend application with React

- [ ] Set up React project with necessary dependencies.
- [ ] Implement core UI components based on design specifications.
- [ ] Integrate mock API data for initial UI development.

## Phase 5: Build backend API integration layer

- [ ] Develop API wrappers for Amazon DSP endpoints.
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [ ] Set up data caching and error handling.

## Phase 6: Test and deploy the complete application

- [ ] Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- [ ] Deploy frontend and backend components.
- [ ] Perform user acceptance testing.

## Phase 7: Deliver final application and documentation to user

- [ ] Prepare final documentation and user guides.
- [ ] Handover deployed application and source code.
