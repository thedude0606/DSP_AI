## Progress Report

### Completed Features or Tasks
- Updated `AmazonDSPService.js` to use `application/json` for `Content-Type` and `JSON.stringify` for the authentication request body.
- Successfully pushed all code changes, including the authentication fix, new `dsp-proxy`, and generated OpenAPI client, to the GitHub repository.
- Changed proxy server port to `8080` and updated frontend `baseURL` accordingly.
- Identified that Amazon requires HTTPS for Return URLs.
- User has successfully set up `ngrok` and added the `ngrok` HTTPS URL to "Allowed Return URLs" in Amazon Security Profile.
- Successfully implemented server-side authentication in `dsp-proxy` to bypass browser-specific restrictions.
- Successfully resolved `ERR_NGROK_8012` by guiding user to run `npm install` and `npm start` in `dsp-proxy`.
- **Authentication flow is now fully functional and `access_token` is being received.**
- **Frontend application is running successfully on http://localhost:3001 with authentication form visible.**
- **Proxy server is running on port 8080 and ready to handle API requests.**
- **Fixed `dsp-proxy/index.js` to correctly add `Bearer` prefix to `Authorization` header and pass all required Amazon Advertising API headers for proxied requests.**

### Current Work in Progress
- Awaiting user re-test of authentication and `getProfiles()` call after proxy fix.

### Known Issues or Challenges
- Previously, `getProfiles()` call was failing due to incorrect `Authorization` header format.

### Next Steps
- Confirm `getProfiles()` call success and proceed to entity/advertiser selection.
- Continue with core DSP functionality development based on user feedback.
